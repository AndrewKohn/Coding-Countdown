Goal for this small project was to use it in the future in conjunction with what was made in Java previously (MyCodingTracker).

### To-Do in the future
1. Link this to the backend w/ ability to store the data regardless of what device I'm currently using.
2. Add a pause/play/stop button to the timer.
3. Look more into media queries and add in orientations.<br/>
  3a. Study difference between rem/em.  Only understand the basics of em; should look into it more.<br/>
  3b. Mobile device scrolling issues with 'height: 100vh'.<br/>
4. Change color theme and css to make things pop out more.
